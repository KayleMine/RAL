<h1>PM User Creator</h1>
A simple program that creates users in Windows.

This program is a part of my school project, the main goal of this is to create a program that is able to mass manage users in Windows.
The function of this program is creating users on RDP servers.
EX: admin creates 100 users using this program and then assigns every user his own number so he can login with name UserXXX, then he chooses his new password and starts using his Remote Desktop.
